Time flies. Initial thoughts on how this blog would turn out was meant to be positive and how being a daddy would magically fall in place, as well as how I would coos, ahhs, and gush over my little baby boy. The reality is, I am beginning to view taking care of my baby boy to be a responsibility, rather than love.

### Do I Love My Baby Boy?

I guess ... but I wouldn't really miss him either. I said soemthing hurtful to my wife two nights ago. I told her I couldn't understand why my dad would fight custody for me twenty five years ago. Did he love me that much? I guess, looking at how he fawn over his grandson. His son, on the other hand, sees his own son as nothing more than a chore. I told her rather blatantly that if we broke up and filed for divorce, I would not even bother to fight for custodial rights of Shane. Words hurt. And I know it worries her. From her, no matter how much our baby boy fusses or cries, he is still her precious baby boy and she loves him unconditionally. I don't know. I can't feel that. I start to question the concept of love. Is it something that comes naturally? Or is it cultivated over time?

#### It's been very tiring

The whole parenthood experience is both physically exhausting and mentally draining. That's something that I hear other parents say, and used to nod in agreement, and perhaps along with empathy, but never realising what it really means.

The whole newborn phase is getting to me. I start to feel frustrated when he cries incessantly. 

The mental exhaustion of not knowing what to do is multiplied by the number of hours you **didn't** sleep. Which will be significant, especially in the first few months. I recount a personal experience. 

It's 2am in the morning. The mummy will be pumping, because well, you need to pump frequently to keep the pump cycles up. Therefore, daddy will be the one feeding the baby if he is up. There are some variants here, but the worst case scenario will be having to get ready the milk if it is in the fridge. That involves warming up, and requires about 5 minutes. If the baby is awake already, that 5 minutes of soothing and placating a hungry baby can feel like a long, long time.

You feed the baby, burp him, and then change his nappy, and before you know it, half an hour is gone. You try to put him back to sleep but he wants to be carried so you hush him and lure him to sleep with a lullaby. That's another half an hour! Finally, the baby eyes are closed and you attempt to put him down, but magically, **he knows**. And he starts to whimper. It's time to restart the rocking and patting for another 10-15 minutes. Finally, you lay him back in the cot, and you look at the clock. It's 1 hour 30 mins to the next feed, and you **STILL** have bottles to wash and sterilise, nappies to throw, and hopefully, **_no shit to clean up**. You start to laugh a little and wonder what's the point to all this madness_.

Things did get better. We moved back to my parent's place, so our domestic helper was a real help with the chores and frequent sterilising of bottles.

We used to keep the expressed milk in the fridge, but figured that there's really no need, and leave it out in the open for up to 12 hours. At least no need to warm up the milk.

We got more skilled in coaxing him to sleep, and recognising his cues better. But they change as they grow older, and it's a constant learning and re-adaptation cycle. 

#### The Scares

There are moments when you are at your wit's end. Like when he is crying incessantly, or when he is not drinking his milk, or when he is sick. As a parent, your heart aches but there's not much you can do. Time and the human body works together as a great healer, but the moment itself is always tough. There will also be many various inputs - well meaning ones but at times unsolicitated, and brings meaning to the phrase of _too many cooks spoil the broth_. But, always remember, you are the one with little or no experience while your parents have handled cranky babies with similar genes to your precious one. **They probably know what to do.**

#### The Solo Car Rides

I thought kids love car rides. Shane loves his cars, but he doesn't fancy taking them alone. I dread the times when I have to drive him alone in the car. It's a cacophony of shrieks and wahs, and can be the entire duration of the ride - which is often 20 minutes or more. It's a combination of heart wrenching and also hair pulling emotions, at the same time.
