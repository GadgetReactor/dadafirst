Has parenting gotten better?

_What doesn't kill you makes you stronger!_

It hasn't been easy - but it has gotten easier. Things move a little more smoothly around here now. Getting him to nap, 
the bathtimes, the feeds and the playtimes have started falling into a routine. There's the ocassional bouts of crankiness but 
thankfully, those aren't too common.

The first couple of months have been about adjustment. Adjusting to life as a new father, learning to handle a newborn, and finally
settling down to routines.

I was a little crazy though.

I changed my job at the start of December. The new environment, learning curve, didn't bode well with being a first time dad either.
As you might have guessed, both aspects suffered, and me, being at the centre of it, suffered as well.
