That moment when we stepped out of Ward 82, there was a slight fear. We are now on our own, baby Shane and the two of us to face the world. No more call button to get the nurses to support us with breast feeding, or nappy changes. The first trial was to fit a small-sized newborn baby into the car seat and that failed miserably. I didn't adjust the straps before and I struggled to fit his small frame in without suffocating him - so it was back to mummy's arms. Not exactly the safest arrangement but we made it home safely.

He was hungry when we reached home and thankfully we survived - although he did cry a bit. We survived the first breastfeeding experience and subsequent diaper change.

We had engaged a confinement nanny from Super Nanny Services, who arrived at 245pm and after a quick introduction, the nanny settled in to help out with baby duties. Nanny's role was to look after baby Shane and mummy. Advice was dished out firmly and politely - _mummy should not walk around barefeet, mummy should be kept warm at all times, mummy needs to sit down while drinking_. I don't really believe in all these old wife tales, but OK, will try to abide by them.

### We Gave Up On Exclusive Breastfeeding

We wanted to breastfeed baby Shane exclusively. But that flew out of the window after day 3. I visited the National Healthcare Group Bukit Batok clinic for the neonatal jaundice follow up and confidently thought with a new born baby, there would be priority. Heck, there were a lot of babies on the Friday I went down. First I had to wait for the blood test, which took a while, as there were other patients inline. But it was the subsequent doctor consultation that required waiting for about 30 minutes. Not to mention the wait for payment, which I skipped first to send the baby home so he can be fed before returning to the polyclinic to make payment.

His bilirubin level had went up, and his weight had also came down to around 2.64kg. Maybe it was the fear of  jaundice, and also we were not sure whether he was fed sufficiently. His urine was also becoming darker in colour and noticed couple of red spots (urate crystals likely) in the diapers - sign of dehydration. We quickly supplemented him with formula milk to encourage more frequent bowel movement. That was the number 1 priority and other concerns on nipple confusion or detriments of formula milk took back stage.

I brought him back to the polyclinic on Saturday for a follow up appointment and that resulted in an even longer wait. We waited for over 30 minutes before I sent mummy home to rest. She was not feeling so good. Luckily, it was just a 5 minutes drive away, but when I returned, our number was called in and had to wait for a re-queue. Anyhow, baby Shane bilirubin level was on the way down, which was a good sign and we were scheduled for a follow up visit the next week. The urate crystals were a bit of a concern and the doctor suggested referring us back to KK Hospital. Anyway, the appointment was a long long way away, and we decided to monitor ourselves his bowel and urine trends. With the supplemental formula milk, he poo-ed and pee-ed more, and the colour for both were on the healthy scale.

At least that's one problem addressed!

### Getting Used to the 3 Hour Sleep Cycle

Actually, new parents don't really sleep 3 hours only. It's less! As 3 hours is from the time you wake up, before the next iteration. We have a confinement nanny, so that already helps a lot. But previously preparing the baby to latch on, or now, getting the breast pumps at night, all takes time. So by the time you go back to sleep, is about an hour later, and then it's a 2 hour nap before the cycle repeats. So the faster you finishing feeding the baby, washing the bottles, pumps, etc, the better. Every minute counts!

No wonder new parents always have dark eye bags. Fathers generally have it easier but do try to help out your wives as much, especially the first few days. It's definitely not easy for her to go at it alone, and don't forget, she just delivered, lost a heck lot of blood, and might have stitches down there too. All these will affect her mobility, and also her mood. My wife is quite the positive and strong person, and she really pushed herself on.

### Taking Lots of Photos

I haven't exactly flooded my friend's Facebook feed with photos of baby Shane, although that is tempting. My photo storage is filled with photos of baby Shane every expression (even repeated ones), poo (yes), urine color, to the cuter shots like winks and smiles.

### Being Frustrated

Yes, I have gone through periods where I questioned my ability to be a parent, a dad to baby Shane. There are times when I picked him up, and he can't stop crying, before I sheepishly hand him back to the confinement nanny or MIL, who seems to have a knack of carrying him. Or times when I insist he is hungry and just barely after a suckle, he rejects the bottle. There are times too, when I'm right. It's tough understanding a baby's needs! I gone through the Dunstan book, and it's generally helpful, but putting or translating the baby noises isn't so simple. Everyday seems to get a little harder too, as he become more alert, and often more hungry. At times, I insist it seems like a growth spurt, but not sure if he is just being overly geedy and guzzling down everything that's put in his mouth. It's tough! Computers and gadgets are way easier to handle :)
