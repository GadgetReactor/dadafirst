Today's 30 Sep, my baby boy Shane is 2 weeks old now! Whew. A lot has happened and like any first time parent, it's a whole new ball game when it comes to parenting. I wanted to set up this blog to record my thoughts before it fades away. Shane has grown up quickly and in just two weeks, it is easy to ride the different emotions such as the fears of a first time parent as I step into the unknown, to the worries when he cries, and to the joys of watching him learn something new. They all come rather fast and furious and perhaps before I know it, he would have grown up.
